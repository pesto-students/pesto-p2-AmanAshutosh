// Problem 6.4 : Best time to buy and sell stock

/*  -6 4-2 3 -2
     ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
   [7,1,5,3,6,4]

price[i] > price[i-1] 
so to make good profit we will try to do as 
 i.e 1st day - rest , 2nd day-buy, 3rd -sell, 4th-buy, 5th- sell,  6th- rest.
 we donâ€™t have any restrictions on the number of transactions
  So every time we will buy a stock at a minimum price and sell it at a maximum price.
